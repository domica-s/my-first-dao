# my-first-dao

This is a repository of me learning the basics of Web 3 via LearnWeb3DAO, and this is the seventh part, where I created my first DAO, where members of the DAO are NFT holders of my previous version, along with the DAO's website, built using React and Next js

View the DAO's contract on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x34A1A0ef6b976d2EB554e1144A387bbb0b473a77
